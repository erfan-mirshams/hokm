## How to play

At first you determine which players are human and which players are bots. In case of several human players it's advised to not look at the other players hand.
The player 1 is the king in the first set. The bots will play accordingly but in your turn you need to specify which card you want to play by entering the index of the desired card that is provided for you in the output of the program.
